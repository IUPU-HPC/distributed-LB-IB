compilation
1) Using Makefile to compile the program it internally uses $gcc -o <filename> <exec name.o> -g -lpthread -lm
											
 Type make on the command prompt to create .o file
Running the executable
2) If the name of executable is file then we need to run the following
	$ ./file  arg1 arg2 srg3 arg4 arg5 arg6 arg7 arg8 arg9 arg10 arg11 
arg1 = fibersheet width
arg2 = fibersheet height
arg3 = total fibers (along height of sheet).
arg4 = total fibers(gridpoints) along width of sheet. NOTE: wdith & height / rows & columns < 1.
arg5- arg7 = fluidgrid dimensions 
arg8- arg11  = Initial position of fibersheet in fluidgrid domain i.e x0,y0,z0 resp
arg 12 = Number of Threads

Sample script: ./scalable_IB 20 20 52 52 64 64 124 20 21.5 11.5 16 >temp.out

DR ZHU's Comment on Testing:
1. " Please note that the code still has two branches in it but only one branch is active, the other one is not considered --- the other branch has
no effects on the computational results. Please compare the data in fpL_kbp005_re150."
2.Code compiled using gcc -c kbp005_re150_1b.c -lm
3.The fluidgrid dimensions are 124, 64, 64 (X,Y,Z) respectively
yes, but to every direction there are 2 layers of buff zone which is not used.
4.To run the file ./zld_IB
